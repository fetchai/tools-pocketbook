# Getting Started

## Installation

This application is available from the PyPI. Simply run the following command to download and install the latest version

```
pip3 install -U pocketbook
```

## Creating a new address

To create a new address simply run the following command:

```
pocketbook create
```

You will be prompted to enter a name for this key pair, followed by a password for the key. Below is a sample output:

```
Enter name for key: foo
Enter password for key...:
Confirm password for key.:
```

## Querying funds

You can query the balance of your account with the following command:

```
pocketbook -n devnet list
```

The example above is querying the `devnet` network. If you do not specify a network, `mainnet` will be used.


## Adding addresses

The wallet also has an address book. You can add addresses with the following command:

```
pocketbook add <name-for-the-address> <address>
```

## Renaming addresses

If you don't like the name that you have given to a wallet, this can be changed with the following command:

```
pocketbook rename <bad-name> <new-name>
```

## Deleting addresses

If you want to remove an address this can be done with the following command:

```
pocketbook delete <name>
```

Be very careful when running the command, because this is not revertable. It could potentially mean that you loose
access to your funds.

When deleting a private key, `pocketbook` will prompt you to enter the full address of the wallet that you want to
delete as a security check.

## Making a transfer

To make a transfer you would use the `transfer` command in the following form:

```
pocketbook -n devnet transfer <destination-name> <amount> <source-main>
```

For example, if you wanted to send `10` FET from your address called `main` to another address called `other` you would
use the following command:

```
pocketbook -n devnet transfer other 10 main
```

You would then be prompted with a summary of the transfer (before it happens) so that you can verify the details.

```
Network....: devnet
From.......: main
Signers....: main
Destination: other: UAHCrmwEEmYBNFt8mJXZB6CiqJ2kZcGsR8tjj3f6GkZuR7YnR
Amount.....: 10.0000000000 FET
Fee........: 0.0000000001 FET
Total......: 10.0000000001 FET (Amount + Fee)
    
Press enter to continue
```

If you are happy with the transfer, then press enter to continue. You will be then prompted for the password for your
signing account.

```
Enter password for key main:
```

After this you except to see the following as the transaction is submitted to the network. This process by default 
blocks until the transaction has been included into the chain

```
Submitting TX...
Submitting TX...complete
```

### Changing the charge rate

By default `pocketbook` chooses the minimum possible fee to be paid, however, if you want to update this, then simply
use the '--charge-rate' or '-R' flag to set the required charge rate
